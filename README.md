A simple emacs setup for Rails
==============================

Uses the very excellent emacs-rails, yasnippet and fuzzy-find-in-project loaded as git submodules. This means you can just git clone this repo, rename it to ~/.emacs.d, then

    cd ~/.emacs.d
    git submodule update --init

This includes wacky keybindings of my own so use at your own peril.
